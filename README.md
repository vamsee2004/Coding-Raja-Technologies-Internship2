Object Detection and Tracking in Videos

->>This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for detecting and tracking objects in videos 

->>using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques. It leverages deep learning models for accurate 

->>object detection and tracking algorithms to maintain consistency across frames

Key Features:

->>Object Detection: Utilizes pre-trained deep learning models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) or 

SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) for efficient real-time object detection in video frames.

->>Object Tracking: Implements various tracking algorithms such as Kalman filters, correlation filters, 

or deep learning-based trackers like DeepSORT (Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) to 

track detected objects across consecutive frames.

->>Multi-Object Tracking: Supports tracking multiple objects simultaneously, maintaining their 

identities across frames even in complex scenarios involving occlusions and interactions.

->>Visualization: Provides visualization tools to display bounding boxes around detected objects and 

their trajectories throughout the video sequence for easy interpretation.

->>Customization: Offers flexibility to fine-tune detection and tracking parameters according to 

specific requirements, ensuring optimal performance for different video datasets.

->>Scalability: Designed to handle videos of varying resolutions and frame rates, making it suitable for

both real-time applications and offline processing of high-definition videos.

Usage:

->>Setup: Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies as mentioned in the README.md file.

->>Data Preparation: Prepare your video dataset or use the provided sample videos for testing

->>Object Detection: Run the object detection module on the video dataset to detect objects of interest in each frame.

->>Object Tracking: Apply the object tracking module to track the detected objects across 

consecutive frames, generating trajectories and maintaining their identities.

->>Visualization: Visualize the results using the provided visualization tools to analyze the 

performance of the detection and tracking algorithms.

Contributions:

->>Contributions to this project are welcome! Whether it's adding support for new detection models, 

optimizing existing algorithms, or improving visualization techniques, your contributions can help 

enhance the functionality and usability of this tool for the broader community.
